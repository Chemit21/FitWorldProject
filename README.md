# FitWorldProject
My website is based on a fictional fitness company that provides online training and meal plans.
I will have a home page that is basically intended to capture the users attention, but it will feature a nav bar that will direct them where they want to go.
My nav bar will include the companies name, a contact us page, a blog, and a page for training and meal plans.
On my home page I will have a carousel that automatically scrolls through a few fitness/food photos.
On the training page I will have additional photos and possibly video examples of workouts.
On the meal plans page, I will have photos of the food options and a mock up of pricing options available.
On the blog page, I will have a blog post accompanied by a photo and an about me section with my photo saying a little about myself.
