      <p>Working out is a great way to relieve stress. Exercise releases endorphins, which are hormones that can improve your mood and create a sense of well-being. It can also help clear your mind, boost your energy levels, and provide a healthy outlet for frustration or anxiety. Plus, the routine of working out can give you a sense of control and accomplishment, which can be really beneficial during stressful times. Do you have a particular type of workout you enjoy?</p>
